# How to think
<p>So what i try to explain is the algorithm use nested function in order to being recursive. The working princible is <strong>similar to wind up mechanism </strong> as in use some old watches. The <strong>op1</strong> value takes a value every step until the <strong>print(op1, op2)</strong> step. It continious last item have been taken by <strong>op1</strong> in items list. Afterward it moves let's say backwards. The <strong>op2</strong> values have been already determined, so it is time to <strong>compare between op1 and op2</strong> in order to find and keep the bigger value. Finally the time that big value have been found it has been kept.</p>
